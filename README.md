Overview

This project explores global health and demographic indicators using datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. It focuses on life expectancy, fertility rates, and population trends, using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical modeling to uncover insights.

🚀 Project Objectives

Analyze global trends in life expectancy, fertility rates, and population.

Clean and preprocess WHO datasets for accurate analysis.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using R.

Create clear and insightful visualizations with ggplot2.

Conduct correlation and regression analysis.

Compare regional blocs such as EAC and SADC.

Provide data-driven insights for health and development research.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

R Programming

ggplot2 for visualizations

dplyr, tidyr for data manipulation

readr, openxlsx for data import/export

corrplot, stats for correlation & regression

WHO & World Bank datasets

📈 Key Analyses & Visualizations

Global life expectancy trends over time

Relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy

Population distribution by continent

Correlation heatmaps

Linear regression model predicting life expectancy

Comparative analysis: EAC vs SADC trends

🔍 Main Insights

Countries with higher fertility rates tend to have lower life expectancy.

African regions show significant disparities across countries.

Population size alone does not directly affect life expectancy without socioeconomic context.

Visualizations highlight patterns useful for policy and academic research.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/who-data-visualization.git


Install required R packages:

install.packages(c("ggplot2","dplyr","tidyr","corrplot","readr"))
